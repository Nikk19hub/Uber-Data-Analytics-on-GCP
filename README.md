# Uber-Data-Analytics-on-GCP
This project demonstrates the development of a scalable, cloud-based analytics pipeline for processing and visualizing taxi trip data using Google Cloud Platform. The end-to-end system extracts meaningful business insights to support data-driven decision-making in transportation operations.

🔧 Key Features and Components:

📁 Data Ingestion:
Raw taxi trip data is stored in GCP Cloud Storage for scalable and secure data management.

🧮 Data Processing:
Utilized Python scripts on GCP Compute Engine to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis.
Implemented logic for calculating trip statistics, patterns, and performance metrics.

🔄 ETL Pipeline Automation:
Integrated the Mage data pipeline tool to automate data workflows and streamline the ETL process across services.

📊 Data Warehousing and Querying:
Loaded the processed data into BigQuery for high-performance SQL querying and analytical operations.

📈 Data Visualization:
Built interactive dashboards in Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio) to present key insights such as:
Ride volume trends
Revenue analysis
Trip duration and distance breakdowns
Geographic heatmaps of pickups and drop-offs

🎯 Business Insights:
Extracted actionable patterns and trends to optimize taxi operations and support strategic planning.
Enabled stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-time, cloud-driven analytics.

☁️ Cloud-Native Architecture:
Designed a modular and scalable architecture entirely on GCP, demonstrating hands-on proficiency with cloud analytics tools.
